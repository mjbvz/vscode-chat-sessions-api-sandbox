# VS Code chat session API sandbox

Sandbox for experimenting with the chat sessions API

## Running

- Make sure you are on latest insiders (some changes may require building from main)
- Run `npm install` in terminal to install dependencies
- Run the `Run Extension` target in the Debug View. This will:
	- Start a task `npm: watch` to compile the code
	- Run the extension in a new VS Code window
